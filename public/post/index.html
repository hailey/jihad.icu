<p>I must run simulations and cost / effect ratios on the most efficient method available to me.  I am running on a tight budget. Until I can promo the idea more at least and find a sponsor I&rsquo;ll need the best ROI I can get.</p>

<p>I believe in open source so I want to document some of the interesting, hard and not well documented domestic terrorism tactics. I wont hold back on technical details so if you aren&rsquo;t into the inner workings this may not be for you, if you are into that, then welcome. I hope you make the info here yours.</p>

<p>Nuclear options are expensive. Warheads cost like $200 million. I can&rsquo;t afford that. Chemical weapons are possible. I&rsquo;ll need to research the precursor and equipment costs, but I doubt its 200 million. Poisons might be a good way, cyanide is easy to get, but hard to deliver over a large area. I suppose I could poison bottled water.</p>

<p>I need something with some serious terror in it. Something lasting. I think it&rsquo;ll have to be bioweapons. Bioweapons spread on their own once released into the wild. Hrm, yes, this is a good idea. It could be a type of cleansing. How accurate could I get it? I don&rsquo;t really want to make the â€˜weapon&rsquo; specific.</p>

<p>A hobby of mine has always been biology. But for this I think I would need to go to school and do some studying. So I guess here is the first step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get Money.</li>
<li>Go to college.</li>
<li>Get more money.</li>
<li>Construct clandestine lab.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be enough for step 1. It&rsquo;ll take a while to build a lab, and while I do that I might as well be in school. I downloaded a few biology e-books. Maybe my next post will be a book review on good starter material once I do a little bit of reading and can do some reviews.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>Study.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what goes after this, maybe someone can help me. I wish I could create a montage and just complete this real quick and go to what will probably be step 37. Thirty seven is a magical number. If I get to that many steps I will know in my mind and soul that the lord wants me to shed blood in the name of Christ. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

      <h1 class="title"><a href="https://jihad.icu/post/introduction-books/">Book Suggestions for June 12th 2018</a></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I think what got me interested in the possibilities of bioweapons in the first place was reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biohazard-Chilling-Largest-Biological-World-Told-ebook/dp/B00IBZ603M/" target="_blank">Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World&ndash;Told from the Inside by the Man Who Ran It</a> by Ken Alibek. That lead me to study to other facilities such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lab-257-Disturbing-Governments-Laboratory-ebook/dp/B000YQHMFG/" target="_blank">Lab 257</a> by Michael C. Carroll.</p>

<p>Then who could forget about outbreaks of dangerous viruses such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/index.html" target="_blank">Ebola</a> or <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank">Marburg</a>? Richard Preston wrote a great book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panic-Level-Cannibals-Viruses-Journeys-ebook/dp/B0015DROZA/" target="_blank">Panic in Level 4</a>. Of course Richard Preston also wrote a lovely book touching on the 2001 <a href="https://anthrax.com/" target="_blank">Anthrax</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks" target="_blank">attacks</a> called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Freezer-True-Story-ebook/dp/B000QCSANQ/" target="_blank">The Demon in the Freezer</a>, an attack that is still unsolved. This is probably the most recent example of bioterror that Americans are particularly aware of. It is extremely hard to tell where diseases come from even if you know the exact strain. Mostly because the differences in weaponizing between countries is less than most are aware of. You can evolve the same traits from the same source genes if they happen to be only a few steps away and you reproduce the experiments, or better yet, if you get ahold of the enemies&rsquo; weapon you can then yourself have the same weapon.</p>

<p>The bioweapons world is a small clique and if I have any chance of getting in I will have to make some friends, socialize&hellip; etc. I want to destroy the world but I think the more I do research the more I think this might be a valid career opportunity that could keep me well to do if I find the right people. I&rsquo;ll just need to make sure I have an <strong>insurance policy</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong><em>Lab 257</em></strong> the author explains how the official story of the purpose of the facility was to do research on infectious animal disease. They did indeed do a lot of that sort of research, but not just for prevention but for offense. Russian bioweapon programs focused on direct attacks at humans while American bioweapons programs had a large focus on agriculture. If you infect the food supply then everyone dies. Or the animals all die and then if anyone wants to live they have to buy food from you. <strong><em>I think this is much more of a capitalist idea than rather just killing you out right and stealing everything you have.</em></strong> The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spillover-Animal-Infections-Human-Pandemic-ebook/dp/B00856PC4K/" target="_blank">Spillover</a> explains how easy it would be for a virus to become strong and spread before detection among wildlife unchecked, much like how <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/index.html" target="_blank">SARS</a> or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/index.html" target="_blank">Zika</a> spread for years before it was fully understood. Zika spread so fast that it was places no one thought to even check for it.</p>

<p>Idealy a virus would be hard to detect, it would have to have a long incubation time until it caused major issues, something hard to treat. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491/" target="_blank">The Great Influenza</a> by John M. Barry explains about one of the deadliest outbreaks which happened in 1918 at the height of WWI. There are a lot of books on this subject, enough to fill a good sized part of your e-book&rsquo;s storage. These are just some of the ones I happen to like.</p>

<p>I just got out of the hospital after weeks of being switched around on medications. None of them really help all they do is make it hard to concentrate and make me forget things and they take away my ability to tell the future, which I need to keep no matter what.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I stopped taking my meds as soon as I got out of the hospital. I was clever and filled my script, that way they will think I&rsquo;m taking it. I have to act a little slow and I have to work harder than ever to suppress my symptoms in public. It&rsquo;s not easy but sober my mind is a laser.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>I have a plan. In the famous words of the Brain&hellip; &ldquo;Try and take over the world!&rdquo; I think I can run it better than others. With the state of things in the world around me I nothing but powerful people aiming to become the most powerful. I don&rsquo;t think any of them are any more qualified than me. I work harder to be honest and faithful than others.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t yet know exactly how to do it just yet. It can&rsquo;t be a typical thing or something that anyone is prepared for. I don&rsquo;t have the budget to refine anything nuclear. Guns aren&rsquo;t effective enough, I&rsquo;d need an army. An army that can grow as it spreads.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told to write down some of my things for therapy reasons. But really I think this is a better engineering task to work out and plan something to let everyone know how wrong they <strong>wrong</strong> they are.</p>

<p>They fucked with the wrong person. More on that later though. This is all for tonight.</p>
