<p>I must run simulations and cost / effect ratios on the most efficient method available to me.  I am running on a tight budget. Until I can promo the idea more at least and find a sponsor I&rsquo;ll need the best ROI I can get.</p>

<p>I believe in open source so I want to document some of the interesting, hard and not well documented domestic terrorism tactics. I wont hold back on technical details so if you aren&rsquo;t into the inner workings this may not be for you, if you are into that, then welcome. I hope you make the info here yours.</p>

<p>Nuclear options are expensive. Warheads cost like $200 million. I can&rsquo;t afford that. Chemical weapons are possible. I&rsquo;ll need to research the precursor and equipment costs, but I doubt its 200 million. Poisons might be a good way, cyanide is easy to get, but hard to deliver over a large area. I suppose I could poison bottled water.</p>

<p>I need something with some serious terror in it. Something lasting. I think it&rsquo;ll have to be bioweapons. Bioweapons spread on their own once released into the wild. Hrm, yes, this is a good idea. It could be a type of cleansing. How accurate could I get it? I don&rsquo;t really want to make the â€˜weapon&rsquo; specific.</p>

<p>A hobby of mine has always been biology. But for this I think I would need to go to school and do some studying. So I guess here is the first step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get Money.</li>
<li>Go to college.</li>
<li>Get more money.</li>
<li>Construct clandestine lab.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be enough for step 1. It&rsquo;ll take a while to build a lab, and while I do that I might as well be in school. I downloaded a few biology e-books. Maybe my next post will be a book review on good starter material once I do a little bit of reading and can do some reviews.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>Study.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what goes after this, maybe someone can help me. I wish I could create a montage and just complete this real quick and go to what will probably be step 37. Thirty seven is a magical number. If I get to that many steps I will know in my mind and soul that the lord wants me to shed blood in the name of Christ. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
