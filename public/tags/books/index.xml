      <description>I think what got me interested in the possibilities of bioweapons in the first place was reading the book Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World&amp;ndash;Told from the Inside by the Man Who Ran It by Ken Alibek. That lead me to study to other facilities such as Lab 257 by Michael C. Carroll.
