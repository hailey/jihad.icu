I&rsquo;ve been faithfully participating in church events that Pastor Monroe has been inviting me to. Having somewhere to go and something to do is helping my depression a lot. I think I am making friends which I haven&rsquo;t been able to do too well in my past. I get along with everyone and they call me a friend but I know they don&rsquo;t really know much about me at all. 

Pastor Monroe has been talking to me and a couple of others about his desire to start his own church due to some disagreements with the current church leadership. Nothing bad or big just differences in how to preach the word of God. I didn&rsquo;t think too much of it because people are always sharing things they are afraid to bring up with others. I did my automatic reaction and that was to support Pastor Monroe in his ideas and that if he did start a new church I would be right there with him. I don&rsquo;t know if I really will be but I was trying to be nice. I mean I kind of mean it. 

 I try and listen because I don&rsquo;t know what else to do. Early on it use to make me nervous but it is amazing how much people will tell you when you don&rsquo;t argue or adversely respond in any way. They tell you one crazy thing and you nod and smile and they think its okay to tell you another crazy thing. If another makes fun of being told cherished secrets and desires then they just don&rsquo;t bring such things up with you. I can&rsquo;t help but want to know what people think about so I always let them rant, reveal and over share. (You never know when it can be handy) I wish I could mind read like others might be able to do to me.

Sometimes when people confide in you, you can do strange things like support unhealthy and detrimental activities over promoting healthy ones. Occasionally people ask for advice even, usually they ask for advice in a way that suggests they are expecting permission or some sort of support for their various schemes. I like to think I am an ***enabler***, I don&rsquo;t mean that I support bad stuff, but I like to help facilitate people&rsquo;s goals and fantasies. Usually I try and help someone or assist in some way, but other times I can&rsquo;t help but be a little sadistic, especially when the voices push me that way. (Thanks to meds tho I&rsquo;m fixed!)

Following Pastor Monroe is probably a good thing, I think he has a lot of insight that others simply lack. The more I think of it the more I realize that this is an important thing to undertake.

I’ve also decided to undertake schooling beyond high school. I’m going to do some of that biology, something that has always been interesting to me.
